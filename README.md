# A Radio Frequency Fingerprint Open Set Identification Method Combining Multi-Scale Wavelets and Hypersphere Representation
### What is it?
This repository provides the code implementation of a radio frequency fingerprint open-set identification method combining multi-scale wavelets and hypersphere representation. The proposed method consists of three main components: a multi-scale feature extraction frontend that utilizes a 1D stationary wavelet transform to extract physical-layer features; a Multi-Scale Residual Attention Network (MS-RANet) that integrates a 1D residual network, global attention mechanism, and BiLSTM to extract high-order semantic representations; and a hypersphere metric learning classification head that converts open-set recognition into cosine similarity-based anomaly detection by optimizing the angular distance of features. Experimental results show that in tests involving 67 known and 20 unknown devices, the classification accuracy of MS-RANet reaches 96% when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 10 dB. At -5 dB, the model's AUC remains stable at 0.82, and its average classification accuracy significantly outperforms the classic ResNet50 and the sub-optimal model DRSN-CA. Furthermore, with a parameter size of only 0.34M and an average inference time of 10.5 ms, the model effectively achieves lightweight device identification and unknown device rejection under complex channel conditions.
### Who will need this code?
This code is suitable for researchers and engineers working in IoT device authentication, wireless physical-layer security, and deep learning-based signal processing. Addressing the issue that fingerprint features are easily interfered with by open network scenarios and multi-path fading channels in existing methods, the method provided in this repository can serve as a lightweight reference baseline for open-set radio frequency fingerprint identification tasks.
### How to use this code?
This code requires MATLAB R2023b or higher and needs the configuration of related toolboxes such as Deep Learning and Communications. To use it, please place all code files and dependent data in the same root directory, and directly run the main training script main.m. The program will automatically complete the parallel simulation of impaired signals, the construction of the multi-scale network, and the end-to-end model training and evaluation process.
